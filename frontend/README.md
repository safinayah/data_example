# Frontend for Data-Driven Weather Project

This folder contains two frontend implementations:

1. **Traditional Frontend**:
   - Fetches and displays raw weather data as text.
   - Located in `traditional_frontend.html`.

2. **Data-Driven Frontend**:
   - Fetches processed weather insights and visualizes data using charts.
   - Located in `data_driven_frontend.html`.

## Instructions
1. Open the desired HTML file in your browser:
   - `traditional_frontend.html` for traditional backend.
   - `data_driven_frontend.html` for data-driven backend.

2. Ensure the backend APIs are running to fetch data successfully.
